> Find something interesting in unlabeled data

## 📝 Key Concepts

### Data Structure
- No labeled outputs
- Finds patterns in raw data
- Uses input features only

## 🔍 Types of Unsupervised Learning

### 1. [Clustering](clustering/README.MD) 📊
> Groups similar data points together automatically

## [Anomaly Detection](anomaly_detection/README.md)
> Identifies rare items, events, or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data

#### Use Cases
- Fraud detection in banking
- Network security threat detection
- Fault detection in manufacturing
