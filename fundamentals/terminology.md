## 🔍 Core Terms

### Training Set 📊
> Collection of labeled examples used to train the model

**Basic Elements:**
- `x` - Input variable (feature)
- `y` - Output/target variable
- `m` - Number of training examples
- `ŷ` - Predicted output (y-hat). Estimated y.

**Training Examples:**
- `(x,y)` - Single training example
- `(x⁽ⁱ⁾,y⁽ⁱ⁾)` - i-th training example (row i in dataset)

**Model:**
- 𝑓 - Function that maps inputs (x) to predictions (ŷ)
- `w,b` - model parameters (aka: coefficients, or weights)
