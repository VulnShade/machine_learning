> Extending linear regression to fit non-linear relationships

## 🔍 Visual Example
![polynomial regression example](images/polynomial_reg_ex.png)

## 📝 Key Concepts
- Add new features by:
  - Raising features to higher powers
  - Taking square root of features
  - Combining features
- Feature scaling becomes increasingly important as power increases

## 💡 Feature Creation Examples
- $x_1^2$ (square)
- $x_1^3$ (cube)
- $\sqrt{x_1}$ (square root)
- $x_1 \cdot x_2$ (multiplication)
